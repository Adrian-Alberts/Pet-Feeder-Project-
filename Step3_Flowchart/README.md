Step 3: Plan the Solution (Design the Algorithm)
-
Create decision logic for dispensing food (e.g., “At 8AM and 6PM, rotate servo to dispense food”).
-
Add logic to detect errors (e.g., “If bowl weight unchanged 10 mins after feeding, send alert”).
-
You must create a flowchart to represent your algorithm using Draw.io. Follow the instructions shown in the appendix of this assignment.
